Here's a list of projects I've done in my work or my spare time.

## Gitty Server

Gitty server is a lightweight Git server written in Java. It is fast and
reliable: it can be started in less than 1 second and can host 1000+ of Git
repositories without problem.
It contains two components: Git and RESTful API.
The Git component is implemented using JGit HTTP.
The API component is implemented by Jersey 1.0 (JAX-RS 1.0). Both components are
hosted inside a Jetty container.
