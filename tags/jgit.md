JGit is an EDL (new-style BSD) licensed, lightweight, pure Java library implementing the Git version control system:

- repository access routines
- network protocols
- core version control algorithms

JGit has very few dependencies, making it suitable for embedding in any Java
application, whether or not the application is taking advantage of other
Eclipse or OSGi technologies. JGit can be found within: EGit, Gerrit Code
Review, NBGit, GitBlit, etc. For more detail, see the official website:
<https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/>.
