Junior software engineer at Nuxeo. My principal interests are web development,
UI design, QA, security, and database. I love beautiful things, such as amazing
UI design and elegant code. Code quality has significant effect on many fields.
I occasionally spend time on [Stack Overflow][so] to answer questions and
[Code Review][cr] community to review code. Reading books is my preferred way
to strengthen existing skills and learn new ones. You can see my reading list
[here][reading-list].

I'm convinced that strong typed language makes our life safer and easier. They
are not handy for small programs, but absolutely worth their value in complex
context. I love cross-platform solutions. I respect all the OS: Windows, Mac
OS, Linux. Hating an OS is easy, writing an OS that fit every user is extremely
hard.

I love programming because I believe high level abstraction gives birth to
beauty.
