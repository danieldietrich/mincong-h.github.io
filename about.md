Junior software engineer at Nuxeo. My principal interests are web development,
UI design, QA, IoT and database. I love beautiful things, not only the amazing
UI design but also elegant code. Code quality has significant effect on many
fields. I occasionally spend time on [Stack Overflow][so] to answer questions
and [Code Review][cr] community to review code. Reading books is my preferred
way to strengthen existing skills and learn new technologies.

Recommended books:

* [Effective Java][effective-java]
* [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction][code-complete]

Recommended online courses:

* [Coursera - Algorithms, Part I (Princeton University)][algs4-1]
