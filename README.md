Hi, welcome to my blog ! I'm a postgraduate CS student who love programming. My blogs represent some problems or 
expriences that I met during my projects or my internships. Most of them are related to `java`, `android`, `excel-vba` 
and `sql-server`. Hope you enjoy them ! 

This blog is powered by [Jekyll][1], a simple, blog-aware, static sites solution.

## Run this blog in localhost

In linux, the jekyll can be launched by the following command :

```sh
$ rvm use 2.3.0
$ jekyll serve
```

Once it is launched, open the web browser and tape the URL <http://localhost:4000>
