Today, I want to write blog post to summarize all the important review notes
for Oracle Certification Associate (OCA) - Java SE 8 Programmer. This post will
be separated into several subjects. They're:

1. Java Basics
2. Java Data Types
3. Methods and Encapsulation
4. Java Core APIs
5. Flow control
6. Inheritance
7. Exception Handling

## Java Basics

- Check access modifier
- Check non-access modifier
- Check return type
- Check method type (constructor, getter / setter)
- Check parameter types

{% highlight java %}
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
// ^   ^      ^    ^    ^
// |   |      |    |    +- parameter type(s)
// |   |      |    +- method type
// |   |      +- return type
// |   +- non-access modifier
// +- access modifier
{% endhighlight %}

Java packages:

- An `import` statement allows to import a class or interface.
- An `import` statement allows to import a package using wildcard `*`.
- An `import static` statement allows to import a static method.
- An `import static` statement allows to import all the static methods of the
target class using wildcard `*`.
- If a `package` statement is present, it must be the first non-commented line
  of code in the file.

Compilation:

- If a variable declaration fails to compile, then all the following lines
  which use this variable will fail to compile, because variable is undefined.
- A local variable must be initialized before being used. Otherwise, Java fails
  to compile at those lines where this variable is used.

## Java Data Types

Primitives

- Characters `char` can be concatenated, such as `'a' + 'b'`. When doing so,
  they are considered as integer using their corresponding value in ASCII
  table.
- Binary number starts with the prefix `0b` or `0B`, e.g. `0b1101`.
- Octal number starts with the prefix `0`, e.g. `011`.
- Decimal number does not start with `0`, e.g. `11`.
- Hexadecimal number starts with the prefix `0x`, e.g. `0xAAA`.
- A literal ends with a character could be a `float`, a `double`, a `long`, or
  a hexadecimal number.
- A `long` can be assigned using an integer `int`, because Java knows how to
  widen the type.
- An integer cannot be assigned as a decimal number automatically.
- Wrapper classes `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, and `Long` cache objects with
  values in the range of `-128` to `127`.
- Wrapper class `Character` caches objects with values `0` to `127`.
- Wrapper class `Boolean` has 2 cached instances, `Boolean.TRUE` and
  `Boolean.FALSE`. They're accessible directly because only two exist.

Operators

- The logical operator AND `&&` has a higher operator precedence than the
  operator `||`.

## Methods and Encapsulation

Constructor

- Initializer blocks are used to initialize the variables of anonymous classes.
- A constructor must not define any return type.
- A default constructor (a public, non-argument constructor) is generated by
  JVM if and only if there's no constructor defined by user.
- A constructor does not have return type, e.g. `void`
- If a subclass does not make an explicit call to a parent constructor, the
  compiler attempts to compensate for this by insert a call to the default
  no-argument constructor `super()`. However, this will fail if there's no such
  constructor in the parent class.
- Overloaded constructors cannot be defined by just a change in the access
  levels.
- A constructor can call another overloaded constructor by using the keyword
  `this`.
- A constructor cannot invoke a constructor by using its class's name.
- If present, the call to another constructor must be the first statement in a
  constructor.

{% highlight java %}
public class A {
  // Method A
  public void A() { ... }

  // Constructor A
  public A() { ... }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Interface

- Interface methods are assumed to be `public` and `abstract` even if they're
  not written as modifier. Therefore, a class implementing the methods of an
  interface must follow the same accessibility: `public`.

Method

- Overloaded method means the method name is the same and the method parameter
  list is different. Anything else is allowed to vary. Remember that Java is
  case sensitive.
- Overloaded methods may or may not define a different return type.
- Overloaded methods may or may not define different access levels.
- Return type is not part of a method signature.
- If you try to execute a method using values that can be passed to multiple
  overloaded methods, in this case, the code will fail to compile.
- The `return` statement need not be the last statement in a method, but it
  must be the last statement to execute in a method.
- If the compiler determines that a `return` statement isn't the last
  statement to _execute_ in a method, the method will fail to compile.
- If the return type of a method is `int`, the method can return a value of
  type `byte`.
- If a `char` variable gets expanded among a list of overloaded methods, it
  will be expanded to its nearest type, e.g. `int` instead of `long`.
- If the return type of a method is `int`, the method can return a value of
  type `byte`.

Garbage Collection

- You can only determine which objects are eligible to be garbage collected.
- You cannot determine when a particular object will be garbage collected. The
  execution of a garbage collector is controlled by the JVM.
- The method `java.lang.Object#finalize()` has `protected` modifier.
- A group of instances with no external references forms an island of
  isolation. which is eligible for garbage collection.

## Java Core APIs

String

- All the string literals are automatically instantiated into a `String`
  object.

String Builder

- `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` have the same methods.
- `StringBuilder` has a constructor without any parameter.
- `StringBuilder` has a constructor with a customized capacity as `int`.
- `StringBuilder` has a constructor with a default capacity and an initial word
  as `String`.

Arrays

- Array anonymous initializer is only allowed in the declaration.

{% highlight java %}
String[] arr = { "A", "B", "C" }; // OK
arr = { "C", "B", "A" }; // Does not compile!
{% endhighlight %}

Date

- Cannot use a `DateTimeFormatter` to format a date object, because it has no
  time.

Lambda Expression

- Parentheses can be omitted ONLY if there's one parameter and the parameter
  type is not declared. So, `(String s) -> ...` or `s -> ...`.

## Flow control

- The braces `{}` are required for methods, `try` blocks, and `catch` blocks
  even if there's only one statement inside.

## Inheritance

Interface

- All interface variables are implicitly assumed `public static final`. For
  these variables, they mush declare a value when they are initialized.
  Otherwise, the compilation fails.

## Exception Handling

Checked exception

- When calling a method having checked exception(s), you must handle them
  properly, e.g. `throws` from method or adding a `try ... catch` block.

Errors

- Error is not a checked or unchecked exception.

## Other notes

- Consider yourself as the Java Compiler
- Read the question carefully. Be careful about the assumption, or the given
  context.
- Read all the options before answer a question. Sometimes multiple choices are
  correct.
- You cannot assume the `import` statement if the code snippet displayed starts
  from line 1. (No previous lines can be hidden in this case.)
- Be careful about the application entry point, it must be `public static void`
  where the position of `public static` can be changed.
